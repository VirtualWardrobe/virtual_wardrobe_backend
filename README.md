## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Enhancements

### FastAPI over Django

- Transitioned to FastAPI for asynchronous processing and real-time interactions.
- Provides automatic OpenAPI documentation and faster response handling.

### Prisma ORM over Django ORM

- Type-safe queries and schema modeling.
- Easier management of wardrobe data, user collections, and outfit combinations.

### PostgreSQL + Neon Serverless

- Upgraded from SQLite to PostgreSQL for better concurrency and scalability.
- Added **Neon Serverless PostgreSQL** for dynamic auto-scaling and cost savings.

### Redis Caching

- Integrated Redis to reduce database load and enhance outfit browsing speed.

### Cloud Infrastructure

- Moved deployment to **Google Cloud Platform**, utilizing:

  - Cloud VMs for scalable compute resources.
  - Cloud Storage for reliable image/media management.

### Scalable Authentication

- Migrated from Django's session-based auth to **JWT** for stateless security.
- Added **Google Authentication (OAuth 2.0)** for seamless login.

### Virtual Try-On

- Introduced real-time visualization of outfits to boost user engagement.

### Database Indexing

- Indexed critical tables (user data, outfits, clothing categories).
- Improved performance for searches, recommendations, and history tracking.
