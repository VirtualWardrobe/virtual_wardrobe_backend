## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend Enhancements ‚Äì Powered by FastAPI, Prisma, and GCP

### FastAPI

- Asynchronous, high-performance API framework.
- Auto-generates OpenAPI (Swagger) docs.
- Fast response times and better scalability.

### Prisma ORM

- Type-safe and auto-generated client.
- Simple schema definitions and DB migrations.
- Clean data modeling for users, items, and outfit combinations.

### PostgreSQL + Neon Serverless

- Replaces SQLite with serverless PostgreSQL for scalability.
- Auto-scaling capabilities to handle fluctuating traffic.

### Redis Caching

- Speeds up browsing and reduces backend load.
- Cached filters, outfits, and frequently queried data.

### Cloud Infrastructure on GCP

- Cloud VMs for compute.
- Cloud Storage for static/media assets.
- Enables CI/CD and scalable deployments.

### Authentication System

- Stateless JWT-based authentication.
- Integrated Google OAuth 2.0 for SSO.
- Scalable and secure.

### Virtual Try-on

- Powered by the virtual try-on API provided by Vertex AI.
- Users can visualize outfits directly in the app.

### Observability with Grafana Loki

- Real-time logs and system health monitoring.
- Debug and analyze across microservices.
